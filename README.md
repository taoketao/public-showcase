EditForm.tsx:
A file for a typescript-react projet that extends the functionality of a website service (selling pre-IPO investments to customers) to include a form that nontechnical administrators can use to quickly view and edit the database in the site itself. This initial version of the panel adds five features (minSharePrice, maxSharePrice, discountPercent, closingSoon, industry). 

Programming features of the panel, as an example of my coding ability, include state-based React code, external libraries for UI, asynchronous programming, functional programming motifs, using typescript utilities to minimize code, and seamless integration into previous code. Limitations include minimal documentation and unscalable testing.

Product features include user management, responsive user input and output, and real-time updating. 

I made it in four days without prior knowledge of React. It works to specifications exactly. Code has been sanitized for anonymity.
